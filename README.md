## Introduction: 
With web developers' rising needs to store an ever-rising amount of structured website data, as well as researchers’ interests in studying people’s foci and reactions when reading medical-related information, a Medical News Database (MeND) is in need to help both groups of people. MeND was developed with the hope that people can not only store Medical News but also conveniently analyze articles with such a database. Sample questions that MeND are efficient in answering include 1) which topics or named entities (medical or non-medical) are mentioned frequently in the articles; 2) What topics are readers mostly interested in; 3) are the websites’ recommendation systems working well? So on and so forth.
